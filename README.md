# RSvgDevice

[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mdecorde/RSvgDevice.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mdecorde/RSvgDevice)

A graphics device that produces clean svg output, suitable for use on the web, and to be edited by hand. Compared to the built-in svg device, this leaves text as is, rather than producing vectorised glyphs.

```R
install.packages("RSvgDevice")
